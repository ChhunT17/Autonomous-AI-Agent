# Contributing to Autonomous AI Agent

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Autonomous AI Agent as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style (use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`)
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style and Standards

- Follow Rust standard formatting using `cargo fmt`
- Run `cargo clippy` for linting
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Write unit tests for new features
- Follow security best practices

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update any relevant documentation
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/btb-finance/Autonomous-AI-Agent/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/btb-finance/Autonomous-AI-Agent/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Priority Areas for Contribution

As mentioned in the README, we particularly need help with:
- Enhanced conversation strategies
- Additional social media platform integrations
- Improved security measures
- Testing and documentation
- UI/UX for monitoring and configuration
